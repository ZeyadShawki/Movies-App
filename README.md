## Introduction

**Clean Architecture** is a software design principle that organizes code into different layers, each with a single responsibility. This separation enhances codebase maintainability, improves testability, and enables scalability. This project adheres to Clean Architecture principles to structure a Flutter application effectively.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three primary layers:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app-preferances/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app-router/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ asset_manger/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helpers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ network/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service_loacater/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ movies/
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ data/
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ remote_data_source/
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ models/
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ repostery/
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ domain/
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ entities/
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ repositories/
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ usecases/
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ presentation/
     â””â”€â”€ screens/
     â””â”€â”€ widgets/
     â””â”€â”€ bloc/
```

## Layers

### Presentation Layer

The **Presentation Layer** is responsible for UI components and user interactions. It communicates with the **Domain Layer** to fetch and display data.

- **Pages**: Contains the screens of the application.
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components.
- **Bloc**: Implements the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management.

### Domain Layer

The **Domain Layer** contains the core business logic and use cases of the application.

- **Entities**: Defines core business objects.
- **Repositories**: Abstract classes defining data access contracts.
- **Use Cases**: Contains application-specific business logic.

### Data Layer

The **Data Layer** is responsible for retrieving and storing data. It implements the repository contracts from the **Domain Layer** and interacts with external sources.

- **Datasources**: Defines the contract for data sources (e.g., APIs, local databases).
- **Models**: Represents data objects for serialization/deserialization.
- **Repositories**: Implements repository interfaces from the **Domain Layer**.

### ðŸ“Œ API Configuration

APIs Used

Get Popular Movies: GET /movie/popular

Get Top Rated Movies: GET /movie/top_rated

Get Recommended Movies: GET /movie/{movie_id}/recommendations

Search Movies: GET /search/movie?query={query}

Get Movie Details: GET /movie/{movie_id}

Screens Using Movies API

- Home Screen:

Displays a list of popular movies, top-rated movies, and recommended movies fetched from the API.

Implements pagination for popular and top-rated movies.

- Search Screen:

Allows users to search for movies using the API's search endpoint.

Implements pagination for search results.

- Movie Details Screen:

Shows detailed information about a selected movie, including synopsis, rating, and cast.

Fetches recommended movies for similar content suggestions.

### State Management

This project uses BLoC (Business Logic Component) and Cubit for state management, ensuring efficient handling of API responses, UI updates, and state transitions.

- Home Screen:

Uses HomeMoiveBloc to manage state for popular movies, top-rated movies, and recommendations.

Implements pagination using BLoC for handling infinite scrolling.

- Search Screen:

Uses SearchCubit to handle search queries and manage state for search results.

Implements pagination for efficient data fetching.

- Movie Details Screen:

Uses  MovieDetailsCubit Cubit to fetch and manage movie details and recommendations dynamically.
